# Tokio + Google Summer of Code

High level organization will happen in this repository.

Chat: http://github.com/tokio-rs/gsoc/
Project ideas: http://tokio.rs/gsoc/

There will be an issue per project idea in this repository. Students may ask questions
and organize in each issue. If there are multiple students in the same project, the project
can be split up and made collaborative or an alternate idea can be proposed.
